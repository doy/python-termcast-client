# termcast

This module is a client for the L<http://termcast.org/> service, which allows
broadcasting of a terminal session for remote viewing. It can be installed
either via `pip install termcast_client` or by downloading the standalone
binary
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doy/python-termcast-client/master/termcast).

To run it, just run `termcast`. A new shell will open, and it will start
streaming data to the termcast server. You can view the contents by following
the instructions at [termcast.org](http://termcast.org/).
